# Getting Started

Welcome to **Asth UI** - a modern component library that combines the developer experience of shadcn/ui with beautiful Framer Motion animations.

## What is Asth UI?

Asth UI is a collection of production-ready, animated UI components that you can install directly into your project using the shadcn CLI. Unlike other component libraries, Asth UI:

- ✅ **CLI-based installation** - Just like shadcn/ui
- ✅ **Fully animated** - Powered by Framer Motion
- ✅ **100% Free** - Open source forever
- ✅ **You own the code** - Components live in your project
- ✅ **Customizable** - Full control over styling

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Next.js 14+ project with App Router
- Tailwind CSS configured
- shadcn/ui initialized

## Installation

### Step 1: Initialize shadcn/ui

If you haven't already set up shadcn/ui in your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Step 2: Install Framer Motion

Asth UI components use Framer Motion for animations:

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

### Step 3: Add Asth UI Registry

Update your `components.json` file to include the Asth UI registry:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "asth-ui": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/registry"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: In production, replace `http://localhost:3000` with your deployed URL.

### Step 4: Install Your First Component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add -r asth-ui animated-button
```

That's it! The component will be installed in your `src/registry/blocks` directory.

## Usage Example

After installation, you can import and use the component:

```tsx
import AnimatedButton from '@/registry/blocks/animated-button'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AnimatedButton>Click me!</AnimatedButton>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## How It Works

1. **You run the CLI command** with the `-r asth-ui` flag
2. **The CLI fetches** component metadata from our registry API
3. **Dependencies are installed** automatically (Framer Motion, shadcn components)
4. **Component is copied** to your project
5. **You're ready to use it** immediately
